o configure the firewall on web-01 to redirect port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP, you can follow these steps:

Log in to web-01 using SSH.
Open the ufw configuration file using a text editor such as nano or vim:
Copy
sudo nano /etc/default/ufw
```
Locate the line that reads DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="DROP" and change it to DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT". This allows the firewall to forward traffic.
Save and close the file.
Open the ufw rules file for IPv4 using a text editor:
Copy
sudo nano /etc/ufw/user.rules
Add the following rule to the file, before the final COMMIT line:
Copy
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
This rule redirects traffic from port 8080 to port 80.
Save and close the file.
Restart ufw to apply the changes:
Copy
sudo ufw disable
sudo ufw enable
Verify that the rule was added successfully using the sudo ufw status command.
Your ufw configuration file should now reflect the changes you made. You can copy the file using the following command:

Copy
sudo cp /etc/default/ufw /path/to/destination/file
Be sure to replace /path/to/destination/file with the actual path and filename of the destination file.
